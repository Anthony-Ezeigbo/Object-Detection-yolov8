In this report, my objective is to demonstrate the use of advanced object detection models to accurately count the 
total number of vehicles in a short video clip and provide an output. There are various models available to address the issues related to object detection 
and tracking, including Faster R-CNN, SDD, YOLO, Mask R-CNN, and SORT. For this task, the YOLO v8 (You Only Look Once version 8) model in Python mode was 
adopted due to its accuracy, speed and ease of implementation in object detection, 
with the integration of ByteTrack, a powerfully built object-tracking method, to 
accurately follow objects across frames and ensure continuity in video analysis.
